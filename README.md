# frontend-resume-builder

## Project Details

### Steps to complete this project

* In this project you will store your resume data in four javaScript objects according to the schema given below. As is often the case when leveraging an API, the objects must follow the schema exactly. All properties must be present and have real or fake values. The names must match those in the schema (note that object and property names are case-sensitive). All property values should be of the data-type given for the property in the schema. For example if the data-type is given as an array, it is not acceptable to use a string as a value for that property.
* All of the HTML code to build the resume is stored in js/helper.js variables. The variable names indicate their function. You will replace substrings in these variable string values such as %data% and # with the data in your javaScript objects, and append or prepend the formatted result to your resume in the appropriate location.

### Files included -
* index.html: The main HTML document. Contains links to all of the CSS and JS resources needed to render the resume, including resumeBuilder.js.
* js/helper.js: Contains helper code needed to format the resume and build the map. It also has a few function shells for additional functionality.
